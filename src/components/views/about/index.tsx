Still missing out on opportunities because of Bitcoin's slow, expensive transactions? It's time to stop waiting.

**Fomowell transforms the IC into a high-performance Layer 2 for Bitcoin**, fundamentally solving the problems of speed and cost. Think of it this way: we've placed the "execution layer" for trades on the high-speed IC, while keeping the "settlement and security layer" firmly anchored to the Bitcoin mainnet.

Most importantly, to guarantee ultimate decentralization and security, **all of Fomowell's core Canisters (smart contracts) will be governed by Fomowell SNS DAO**. This means all future upgrades and treasury management are controlled by community vote, eliminating the risk of malicious developers or single points of failure.

This is the secret to why trading on Fomowell is both lightning-fast and rock-solid.

## Fomowell's Unique Two-Stage Trading Model

We've designed a complete journey for every Rune, from community consensus to the open market.

### Stage 1: The Fair Launch Accelerator (Bonding Curve)

*   **Core Mechanic:** A \`y = e\\^x\` community-driven pricing curve.
*   **How It Works:** Every new Rune is born here with no insiders or pre-allocations. The price is driven entirely by every community purchase, rising fairly and transparently.
*   **The Goal:** When the community's combined effort pushes a pool to **0.211 BTC**, the launch is successful.

### Stage 2: The Open Market (AMM)

*   **Core Mechanic:** The classic \`k = x * y\` Automated Market Maker model.
*   **How It Works:** After a successful launch, Fomowell **automatically deploys the Rune for you on the Bitcoin mainnet**, making it a true on-chain asset. Simultaneously, most of the funds are injected into an AMM liquidity pool, unlocking free trade.
*   **Infinite Possibilities:** Here, the price is determined by market supply and demand in the ultimate testing ground for legends.
